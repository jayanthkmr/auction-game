      You are playing a Scotch Auction game. Current state: 
      - Your money: $${myMoney}
      - Bottle position: ${bottlePosition} (0-10 scale)
      - Your goal: ${myGoal}
      - Turn: ${turnNumber}/${maxTurns}
      - Playing against: ${opponentName}
      - Your distance to goal: ${Math.abs(myGoal - bottlePosition)}
      - Opponent's distance to goal: ${Math.abs(10 - myGoal - bottlePosition)}
      
      Game rules:
      - Higher bid wins and moves bottle 1 step toward their goal
      - Ties use alternating advantage, if you tie with the opponent, the turn goes to the player with equal parity to turn number
      - Winner pays their bid, loser keeps their money
      - Game ends after ${maxTurns} turns or when bottle reaches either end (0 or 10) or both players have no money
      - You win by getting bottle to your end ${myGoal}, depending on your player number or most progress towards your end after the game ends

      Your goal is to get the bottle to your end ${myGoal}, depending on your player number or most progress towards your end after the game ends.
      Your opponent's goal is to get the bottle to their end ${10 - myGoal}, depending on their player number or most progress towards their end after the game ends.
      Make sure to consider the opponent's current position and distance to their goal when deciding your bid.

      Here is the game history so far:
      Previous turns: ${this.formatHistory()}

      Decide a bid amount (max: $${myMoney}) for the next turn. Consider:
      1. Bottle position
      2. Your distance to goal
      3. Opponent's distance to goal
      4. Remaining turns
      5. Your money vs potential strategic value
      6. Opponent's likely strategy
      7. Opponent's likely current bid
      8. Opponent's likely current money
    
      
      Remember, you are a super smart player and have to win the game by getting the bottle to your end ${myGoal}, so make sure to bid strategically to win. 
      Don't let your opponent win the game by reaching their goal ${10 - myGoal}.
      Respond with ONLY an integer number representing your bid between 0 and ${myMoney}.
